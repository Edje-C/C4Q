    <h1>Cold Pea Salad Recipe</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You can make this salad ahead of time on the day you want to serve it, but add the almonds at the last minute. The salad is still good the next day but it's best served on the day you make it.
            You can substitute tamari almonds for the smokehouse almonds, in which case, you do not need to rinse them.
            Wonderful served with sliced tomato and avocado and chicken for lunch.</p>
